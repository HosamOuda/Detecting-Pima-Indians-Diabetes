<h2>Project overview</h2>
<p>A machine learning project used to to identify whether the patient has diabetes or not based on diagnostic measurements through different machine learning models instead
of going to the medical centers and wait for the results</p><br>
<h2>Problem description : 📖📚 </h2>
<p>Given the diabetes dataset which has 
<ul>
  <li>Pregnancies: No. of times pregnant</li>
  <li>Glucose: Plasma Glucose Concentration (mg/dl)</li>
  <li>Blood Pressure: Diastolic Blood Pressure(mmHg)</li>
  <li>Skin Thickness: A value used to estimate body fat.</li>
  <li>Insulin: 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml)</li>
  <li>BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/ height in m2)</li>
  <li>Diabetes Pedigree Function: It provides information about diabetes history in relatives and genetic relationship of those relatives with patients. Higher Pedigree Function means patient is more likely to have diabetes.</li>
  <li>Age:Age (years)</li>
  <li>Outcome: Class Variable (0 or 1) where ‘0’ denotes patient is not having diabetes and ‘1’ denotes patient having diabetes.</li> 
</ul><br>
